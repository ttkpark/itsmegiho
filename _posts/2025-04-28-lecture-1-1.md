## 2. Embedded Rust vs. C++: Paradigm Shift

As experienced C++ embedded programmers, you'll find both similarities and significant differences when working with Rust. Let's examine the key differences and why they matter for embedded development.

### 2.1 Memory Safety Guarantees

**C++ Approach:**
```cpp
void processData() {
    int* data = new int[100];
    // Process data
    // What if we forget to delete[]?
    // What if an exception occurs before deletion?
    delete[] data; // Manual cleanup required
}
```

**Rust Approach:**
```rust
fn process_data() {
    let data = vec![0; 100]; // Vector with 100 zeros
    // Process data
    // When function ends, data is automatically dropped
    // Even if panic occurs, cleanup still happens
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- Rust enforces memory safety at **compile time**
- No need for manual memory management
- No dangling pointers, use-after-free, or double-free errors
- Automatic cleanup even in error conditions
- No garbage collection overhead

**Embedded Impact:** 
Memory leaks in embedded systems can be catastrophic, leading to system crashes after prolonged operation. Rust eliminates these issues at compile time.

### 2.2 Compilation Model Differences

**C++ Compilation:**
- Header files and implementation files
- Manual include guards or #pragma once
- Macros extensively used for configuration
- Separate compilation and linking steps
- No safety checks for null pointer dereferencing

**Rust Compilation:**
- Module system with explicit imports
- No header files needed
- Macros are hygienic (don't pollute global namespace)
- Compiler verifies all references are valid
- Features can be conditionally compiled

**Example Rust Module System:**
```rust
// In lib.rs
pub mod sensors; // Declares module
pub mod display; // Declares another module

// In sensors.rs
pub fn read_temperature() -> f32 {
    // Implementation
    22.5
}

// In main.rs
use my_project::sensors;
use my_project::display;

fn main() {
    let temp = sensors::read_temperature();
    display::show_value(temp);
}
```

**Embedded Impact:**
Rust's compilation model helps avoid subtle bugs common in embedded C++ systems, like name clashes and type mismatches between headers and implementation.

### 2.3 Zero-Cost Abstractions

Both C++ and Rust aim for "zero-cost abstractions," meaning high-level constructs that compile down to efficient machine code without runtime overhead.

**Example: Iterating over an array**

**C++ Approach:**
```cpp
void processValues(int* values, size_t length) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        // Process values[i]
    }
}
```

**Rust Approach:**
```rust
fn process_values(values: &[i32]) {
    for value in values {
        // Process *value
    }
}
```

The Rust iterator compiles to machine code as efficient as the C++ indexed loop, but with added safety and readability.

**Real-World Example:** Rust's `Iterator` trait provides map, filter, and fold operations that compile to highly optimized code without heap allocations or function pointer indirection when used properly.

### 2.4 Static Type Checking and No Runtime Overhead

**C++ Error Handling:**
```cpp
bool readSensorData(SensorData* data) {
    if (!sensorConnected()) {
        return false;  // Error indicated by return value
    }
    // Fill data
    return true;
}

void processSensorData() {
    SensorData data;
    if (readSensorData(&data)) {
        // Process data
    } else {
        // Handle error
    }
    // Did we remember to check the return value?
}
```

**Rust Error Handling:**
```rust
fn read_sensor_data() -> Result<SensorData, SensorError> {
    if !sensor_connected() {
        return Err(SensorError::NotConnected);
    }
    // Fill data
    Ok(SensorData { /* ... */ })
}

fn process_sensor_data() -> Result<(), SensorError> {
    let data = read_sensor_data()?; // Error is propagated if present
    // Process data
    Ok(())
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- Rust's `Result` type forces error handling at compile time
- The `?` operator provides elegant error propagation
- No exceptions or runtime type information (RTTI)
- No hidden control flow

**Embedded Impact:**
Error handling in embedded systems is critical. Rust ensures you always handle or explicitly propagate errors, avoiding silent failures.
