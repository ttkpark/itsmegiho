# Lecture 1.2: Setting Up the Rust Toolchain for ESP32

## Introduction

In this lecture, we'll set up a complete development environment for programming the ESP32 in Rust. By the end, you'll have a functioning toolchain that allows you to compile, flash, and debug Rust programs on your WiFi-LoRa-32-V2 board.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lecture, you will be able to:
- Install and configure the Rust programming language
- Set up ESP32-specific tooling for Rust development
- Configure an integrated development environment (IDE) for embedded Rust
- Create, build, and flash a simple Rust project to your ESP32

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this setup process, ensure you have:
- Administrative/sudo access to your computer
- A stable internet connection
- At least 5GB of free disk space
- WiFi-LoRa-32-V2 board and USB-C cable
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces

## 1. Rust Installation and Setup

Rust uses a tool called `rustup` to manage the installation and different versions of the Rust compiler and its components.

### 1.1 Installing Rust and Rustup

#### For Windows:
1. Download the rustup installer from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Run the downloaded executable
3. Choose option 1 for the default installation
4. Install the recommended Visual Studio C++ Build Tools when prompted
5. After installation, open a new command prompt to verify:
   ```
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

#### For macOS and Linux:
1. Open a terminal window
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
3. Choose option 1 for the default installation
4. Add Rust to your current shell's path:
   ```bash
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```
5. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

### 1.2 Adding the Xtensa Target Support

The ESP32 uses the Xtensa instruction set, which is not officially supported by the Rust compiler. We'll use a fork of the Rust compiler that adds support for ESP32's Xtensa architecture.

#### For all platforms:

1. Install the Rust ESP32 build tools:
   ```bash
   cargo install espup
   ```

2. Use espup to install the required toolchain components:
   ```bash
   espup install
   ```

3. Source the export file that espup created (you'll need to do this each time you open a new terminal):
   - For Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     . $HOME/export-esp.sh
     ```
   - For Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     . $HOME/export-esp.ps1
     ```

4. Verify the Xtensa target has been added:
   ```bash
   rustc --print target-list | grep xtensa
   ```
   
   You should see output including `xtensa-esp32-none-elf`.

### 1.3 Installing Additional Dependencies

#### Install ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework):

1. Install Git if you don't already have it:
   - [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - macOS: `brew install git` (with Homebrew) or use the [installer](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install git` (Fedora)

2. Install Python 3.7 or newer:
   - [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - macOS: `brew install python` (with Homebrew) or use the [installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip` (Fedora)

3. Install ESP-IDF using the espup tool (which we installed earlier):
   ```bash
   espup install
   ```
   
   This sets up all necessary ESP-IDF components and cross-compilation tools.

#### Install USB Drivers (Windows only):

1. Download and install the [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
2. Connect your WiFi-LoRa-32-V2 board and check Device Manager to ensure it's recognized as a COM port

## 2. IDE Configuration

A good IDE setup will make developing Rust for ESP32 much more productive. We'll use Visual Studio Code with Rust-specific extensions.

### 2.1 Installing Visual Studio Code

1. Download and install VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Launch VS Code after installation

### 2.2 Installing Required Extensions

In VS Code, install the following extensions by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS) and searching for:

1. **rust-analyzer** - Provides Rust language support
2. **Better TOML** - For editing Cargo.toml files
3. **Rust Test Explorer** - For running Rust tests
4. **Rust Flash** - For flashing ESP32 boards
5. **Serial Monitor** - For UART communication with the board

To install an extension, search for it and click the "Install" button.

### 2.3 Configuring VS Code for ESP32 Development

1. Create a new settings.json file or edit your existing one:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
   - Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and select it

2. Add the following settings:

```json
{
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.target": "xtensa-esp32-none-elf",
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.allTargets": false,
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command": "clippy",
    "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {
        "PATH": "${env:PATH}:${env:HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
    },
    "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
        "PATH": "${env:PATH}:${env:HOME}/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
    },
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "PATH": "${env:PATH};${env:USERPROFILE}\\.espressif\\tools\\xtensa-esp32-elf\\esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0\\xtensa-esp32-elf\\bin"
    }
}
```

Note: The exact paths may vary depending on the version of the tools installed. Adjust according to your actual installation paths.

### 2.4 Configuring Debugging (Optional)

For more advanced debugging capabilities:

1. Install the **Cortex-Debug** extension in VS Code
2. Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file in your project with the following content:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "cortex-debug",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug ESP32",
            "servertype": "openocd",
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "preLaunchTask": "Build (debug)",
            "runToEntryPoint": "main",
            "executable": "${workspaceRoot}/target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/debug/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
            "openOCDLaunchCommands": [
                "target extended-remote :3333"
            ],
            "configFiles": [
                "interface/ftdi/esp32_devkitj_v1.cfg",
                "target/esp32.cfg"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: Hardware debugging requires additional hardware (JTAG adapter). This is optional and not required for the course.

## 3. ESP-IDF and ESP-RS Integration

The ESP-RS project provides Rust bindings for the ESP-IDF C APIs, allowing us to use all ESP32 features from Rust.

### 3.1 Understanding the Relationship Between ESP-IDF and Rust

ESP-IDF is Espressif's official development framework for ESP32, written in C. The ESP-RS project provides:

1. **esp-idf-sys** - Low-level bindings to ESP-IDF C APIs
2. **esp-idf-hal** - Hardware abstraction layer following the embedded-hal traits
3. **esp-idf-svc** - Higher-level services like WiFi, Bluetooth, HTTP server, etc.

This layered approach allows us to write Rust code that interfaces with the ESP32 hardware while taking advantage of Rust's safety features.

### 3.2 ESP-IDF-SYS Bindings

The `esp-idf-sys` crate provides raw bindings to the ESP-IDF C APIs. It's automatically included when you use the higher-level crates, but understanding its role is important:

- **Direct C bindings:** Provides access to all ESP-IDF functions through Rust FFI
- **Unsafe APIs:** Most functions are marked as `unsafe` since they're C functions
- **Global state:** The ESP-IDF uses global state, which doesn't align with Rust's ownership model

We'll typically use the higher-level abstractions, but occasionally we'll need to use these low-level bindings directly.

### 3.3 ESP-RS Project Ecosystem

The ESP-RS ecosystem includes several components:

1. **esp-rs/esp-idf-template** - Template for new projects
2. **esp-rs/esp-idf-hal** - Hardware abstraction layer
3. **esp-rs/esp-idf-svc** - Services like WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.
4. **esp-rs/embedded-svc** - Traits defining common embedded services
5. **esp-rs/esp-idf-sys** - Low-level bindings to ESP-IDF
6. **esp-rs/esp-idf-build** - Build support for ESP-IDF projects

For our course, we'll primarily use a template that integrates these components.

## 4. Project Structure and Cargo.toml Configuration

Let's create our first Rust project for the ESP32.

### 4.1 Creating a New Project Using the Template

1. Install cargo-generate to use project templates:
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-generate
   ```

2. Generate a new project using the ESP-IDF template:
   ```bash
   cargo generate --git https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template cargo
   ```

3. When prompted:
   - Enter a project name (e.g., `esp32-hello-world`)
   - Select the ESP32 chip
   - Choose "std" for the async executor
   - Choose the latest ESP-IDF version

4. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd esp32-hello-world
   ```

### 4.2 Understanding the Project Structure

The generated project has the following structure:

```
esp32-hello-world/
├── .cargo/
│   └── config.toml       # Cargo configuration
├── src/
│   └── main.rs           # Main application code
├── .gitignore
├── build.rs              # Build script
├── Cargo.toml            # Project dependencies
├── rust-toolchain.toml   # Rust toolchain specification
└── sdkconfig.defaults    # ESP-IDF configuration
```

Let's look at the key components:

#### The main.rs file:

```rust
use esp_idf_sys as _; // If using the `binstart` feature of `esp-idf-sys`, always keep this module imported

fn main() {
    // It is necessary to call this function once. Otherwise some patches to the runtime
    // implemented by esp-idf-sys might not link properly. See https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template/issues/71
    esp_idf_sys::link_patches();
    
    println!("Hello, ESP32!");
}
```

#### The Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[package]
name = "esp32-hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
edition = "2021"
resolver = "2"

[dependencies]
esp-idf-sys = { version = "0.32.1", features = ["binstart"] }

[build-dependencies]
embuild = "0.31.0"

[profile.release]
opt-level = "s"
```

### 4.3 Customizing the Cargo.toml Configuration

Let's update the Cargo.toml file to include the libraries we'll use throughout the course:

```toml
[package]
name = "esp32-hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
edition = "2021"
resolver = "2"

[dependencies]
esp-idf-sys = { version = "0.32.1", features = ["binstart"] }
esp-idf-hal = "0.40.1"
esp-idf-svc = "0.45.0"
embedded-hal = "0.2.7"
embedded-svc = "0.24.0"
log = "0.4.17"
anyhow = "1.0.69"

[build-dependencies]
embuild = "0.31.0"

[profile.release]
opt-level = "s"
```

These dependencies provide:
- **esp-idf-hal**: Hardware abstraction layer for ESP32
- **esp-idf-svc**: Services like WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.
- **embedded-hal**: Traits for hardware abstraction
- **embedded-svc**: Traits for embedded services
- **log**: Logging infrastructure
- **anyhow**: Error handling utilities

### 4.4 Build Profiles for Debug and Release

The Cargo.toml file includes a release profile with `opt-level = "s"`, which optimizes for binary size. We can add more detailed profiles:

```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1      # Medium optimization in dev mode for ESP32

[profile.release]
opt-level = "s"    # Optimize for size
lto = true         # Enable link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1  # Maximum optimization (slower build)
```

These profiles control how Rust compiles your code:
- **dev**: Used during development, compiles faster but larger binary
- **release**: Used for final binaries, optimized for size and performance

## 5. Building and Flashing Your First Project

Now let's build and run the Hello World project on your ESP32.

### 5.1 Connecting Your ESP32 Board

1. Connect your WiFi-LoRa-32-V2 board to your computer using the USB-C cable
2. Identify the serial port:
   - Windows: Check Device Manager under "Ports (COM & LPT)"
   - macOS: Run `ls /dev/cu.*` in Terminal
   - Linux: Run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` or `ls /dev/ttyACM*`

### 5.2 Building the Project

1. In your project directory, run:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

2. This will compile your project for the ESP32 target. You should see output showing the compilation progress and a successful build message.

### 5.3 Flashing the Project

1. To build and flash your project to the ESP32, run:
   ```bash
   cargo espflash flash --monitor
   ```

2. If the serial port isn't automatically detected, specify it:
   ```bash
   cargo espflash flash --port COM3 --monitor  # Replace COM3 with your port
   ```

3. You should see output showing the flashing progress, followed by serial output from the board.

4. Look for "Hello, ESP32!" in the serial output, which confirms your program is running.

### 5.4 Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Port access denied**:
   - Windows: No action needed
   - macOS/Linux: Add yourself to the dialout group or use sudo:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER  # Log out and back in after this
     ```

2. **Board not detected**:
   - Ensure the USB cable is properly connected
   - Try a different USB port
   - Check driver installation on Windows

3. **Build errors**:
   - Ensure you've properly set up the ESP32 target
   - Check that you've sourced the export file (`source ~/export-esp.sh`)
   - Verify dependencies in Cargo.toml

4. **Flashing errors**:
   - Hold the BOOT button while starting the flash process
   - Ensure you're using the correct port
   - Try resetting the board before flashing

## Lab Exercise: Setting Up and Verifying the Development Environment
